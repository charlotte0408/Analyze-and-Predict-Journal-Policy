## Analyze-and-Predict-Journal-Policy

#### Introduction
This project guided the preparation of registered reports for successful publication. Registered report is a new way for manuscript publication, and this policy has not been well-established. I aimed to provide an overall guideline on how to prepare for the registered reports, including what to add in the manuscript, and which journal to publish. I researched 100+ journalsâ€™ policies of registered reports with a group of 4 students. I transformed raw text data and developed predictive analytics policies for journals using SQL and R.
Due to the data privacy, only the poster for presentation is included.
